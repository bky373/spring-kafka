== What's New in 3.3 Since 3.2
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

This section covers the changes made from version 3.2 to version 3.3.
For changes in earlier version, see xref:appendix/change-history.adoc[Change History].

[[x33-dlt-topic-naming]]
=== DLT Topic Naming Convention

The naming convention for DLT topics has been standardized to use the "-dlt" suffix consistently.
This change ensures compatibility and avoids conflicts when transitioning between different retry solutions.
Users who wish to retain the ".DLT" suffix behavior need to opt-in explicitly by setting the appropriate DLT name property.

[[x33-seek-with-group-id]]
=== Enhanced Seek Operations for Consumer Groups

A new method, `getGroupId()`, has been added to the `ConsumerSeekCallback` interface.
This method allows for more selective seek operations by targeting only the desired consumer group.
For more details, see xref:kafka/seek.adoc#seek[Seek API Docs].
